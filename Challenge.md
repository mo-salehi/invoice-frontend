# Invoice frontend code challenge

## The task

### Description
The task is to build an invoice displaying app. The challenge contains a existing react application. We would like you to clean it up, create a reasonable component structure and load invoice data from the API provided. 

### Expectation

The result should be:
- Convert the skeleton react invoice into a dynamic invoice 
- Pull the invoice data from the server and display the results
- Calculate the total of line items of the invoice
- Add/Remove line items to the invoice (client side)
- Support persistence in an in-memory store on the Node.js server (optional)

We expect you to write code you would consider production-ready. This means your code should be simple, robust and follow good practices. If you decided for certain design decisions, please document them and explain why you have chosen them. Last but not least, please document your solution in version control (git, bitbucket, etc.) and share the repository with us.
